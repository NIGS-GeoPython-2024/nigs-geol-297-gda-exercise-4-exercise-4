# Exercise 4: Functions (10 points)

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand how to create and use functions in Python.
You will create a simple tool that converts seismic moment from one kind of temperature scale to another and then classify those temperatures into specific temperature classes.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 4 is due by the start of the next lesson (1 PM, 16 March 2024)**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!
- **We are [working in pairs](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) on this exercise**, and we will only grade the repository of the member of your pair that is responsible for this week's exercise.

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 4](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L4/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L4/exercise-4.html#exercise-4-hints) if you're having trouble.

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 4 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and use your own Exercise 4 repository (e.g., `exercise-4-jdaled`) that you will find in our [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/97962678-geol-197-gdam) or [the course GitHun page](https://github.com/NIGS-GeoPython-2022/).
